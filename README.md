Clustering Real Estate Data: A Comparative Study of Gaussian Mixture Models and K-Means

In this project, real estate analysis was conducted using clustering techniques such as KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). By evaluating factors like property location, market trends, and pricing, these clustering methods grouped similar properties together, aiding in the assessment of property value and investment potential. This analysis helps buyers make informed decisions, minimize risks, and maximize returns on their investments, ensuring successful real estate transactions
